# Galaxy rpThermo

Galaxy tool that reads a collection of rpSBML files, parses the IBIBSA annotation tags containing the SMILES or InChI structure to calculate the formation energy of the molecules, calculate the Gibbs free energy of reactions and finally calculate the Gibbs free energy of the hererologous pathway.

## Getting Started

This is a docker galaxy tools, and thus, the docker needs to be built locally where Galaxy is installed. 

### Prerequisites

* Docker - [Install](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/)
* libSBML - [Anaconda library](https://anaconda.org/SBMLTeam/python-libsbml)
* Component Contribution - [Git to the project](https://gitlab.com/elad.noor/component-contribution)

### Installing

Create a new section in the Galaxy tool_conf.xml from the config file:

```
<section id="retro" name="Retro Nodes">
  <tool file="/local/path/wrap_rpThermo.xml" />
</section>
```

Make sure that docker can be run as root. It's important to run the docker as root user since it will be calling a script that writes files to a temporary folder inside the docker before sending back to Galaxy:

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
sudo service docker restart
```

Build the docker image:

```
docker build -t brsynth/rpthermo-rest .
```

Make sure that the following entry exists under Galaxy's destination tag in job_conf.xml:

```
    <destination id="docker_local" runner="local">
      <param id="docker_enabled">true</param>
      <param id="docker_sudo">false</param>
      <param id="docker_auto_rm">true</param>
      <param id="docker_set_user">root</param>
    </destination>
```

And that the destination of the tool is refered under the tools tag of job_conf.xml:

```
    <tool id="rpThermo" destination="docker_local" />
```

Finally, make sure that you give the python scripts execution permission:

```
chmod 755 *.py
```

## Running the service

```
docker run -p 8883:8888 brsynth/rpthermo-rest
```
